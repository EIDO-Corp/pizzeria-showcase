// Frequently asked questions
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What characterizes an authentic Neapolitan pizza?",
    answer: "Authentic Neapolitan pizza is recognized by its supple and airy dough, its puffed edge (cornicione), its thin base in the center, and its quick wood-fired baking which gives it characteristic small charred spots."

  {
    question: "Do you use local ingredients?",

            <p className="text-lg mb-6">
              Founded in 2010 by Neapolitan chef Giuseppe Romano, our pizzeria was born from a passion for authentic Italian culinary traditions. After working in the best pizzerias in Naples, Giuseppe decided to share his love for real Neapolitan pizza with Paris.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-6">
              Our modest beginnings in a small location in the 11th arrondissement quickly evolved thanks to word of mouth and our unwavering commitment to quality. Today, our establishment is recognized as one of the best pizzerias in the capital, but we remain true to our roots and our philosophy: fresh ingredients, traditional recipes, and wood-fired cooking.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Every step of our development has been guided by respect for ancestral methods and the pursuit of excellence that characterize true Neapolitan pizza.

              Our dough ferments slowly for 48 hours, giving it its characteristic lightness and digestibility. Each pizza is hand-shaped and baked in our wood-fired oven at over 450Â°C for 60 to 90 seconds.
